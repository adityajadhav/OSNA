Introduction 
Recently Bitcoin hits record high, breaks $9,000 over Thanksgiving weekend which fascinated me to do an analysis on twitter data involving tweets related to bitcoin and see the how many of them are positive, negative & neutral.
Main motive of the analysis is to see what people think about how is bitcoin going to perform in the near future.

collect.py
    - It collects by default 100 tweets based on keywork 'bitcoin' and store it in a file called 'bitcoin_tweets.txt' inside a folder 'data'
    - All retweets are ignored in order to get unique tweets.
    - From the tweets collected, users are extracted along with their friends and store it in a file called 'bitcoin_tweets_friends.txt'

cluster.py
    - It reads 'bitcoin_tweets_friends.txt' file generated by collect.py and creates a graph between users using jaccard similarity with minimum edge score of 0.002
    - Subgraph with a specific min-degree is considered to generate connected components.
    - Clustering is performed on above graph using girvan-newman algorithm. 
    - The output is store in a file called 'cluster_result.txt' & 'network.png'.

classify.py
    - Used affin library to get all the positive and negative words.
    - It reads 'bitcoin_tweets.txt' to extract tweets text and clean them up to remove any urls, mentions etc.
    - Cleaned tweets data is passed to classfy function which classify them into three classes positive, negative & neutral.
    - The output is store in a file called 'classify_result.txt' 

summarize.py
    - It just append the output of cluster.py and classify.py into 'summary.txt'

Conclusion 
    - The number of users per community are high which shows the popularity of bitcoin.
    - The number of positive instances are a bit higher than the negative instances which indicates mixed reaction. 
    - Although, majority of the instances found belong to neutral class, 
    Thus, it can be concluded that most of the people have turned neutral on bitcoin and are not really sure whether it will be acheiving a new high or stooping to a level down.
